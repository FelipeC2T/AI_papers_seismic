**Abstract:**  
Deepfakes are a type of synthetic media created using artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning algorithms. This technology can for example superimpose faces and voices onto videos, creating hyper-realistic but artificial representations. Deepfakes pose significant risks regarding misinformation and fake news, because they can spread false information by depicting public figures saying or doing things they never did, undermining public trust. In this paper, we propose a method that lev...

**Abstract:**  
Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweig...

**Abstract:**  
Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomp...

**Abstract:**  
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are biologically inspired, event-driven models that are suitable for processing temporal data and offer energy-efficient computation when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. In SNNs, richer neuronal dynamic allows capturing more complex temporal dependencies, with delays playing a crucial role by allowing past inputs to directly influence present spiking behavior. We propose a general framework for incorporating delays into SNNs through additional state variables...

**Abstract:**  
We develop an interpretable, data-driven framework to quantify how single-particle band geometry governs the stability of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Using large-scale exact diagonalization, we evaluate an FCI metric that yields a continuous spectral measure of FCI stability across parameter space. We then train Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) -- a recently developed interpretable neural architecture -- to regress this metric from two band-geometric descriptors: the trace violation $T$...

**Abstract:**  
A central challenge in machine learning is to distinguish genuine structure from chance correlations in high-dimensional data. In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $α$ and the variable selection ratio $ρ$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = αN$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = ρN$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Ga...

**Abstract:**  
Low-rank approximation methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and its variants (e.g., Fisher-weighted SVD, Activation SVD) have recently emerged as effective tools for neural network compression. In this setting, decomposition acts as a "surgical" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as "rehab" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre-compression fine-tuning stage, Low-Rank Prehab, that explicitly encourages low-rank structure in we...

**Abstract:**  
Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) and its variants aim to speed-up training by using gradient corrections, but have seen limited success in deep learning. Here, we show surprising new foundational connections of SVRG to a recently proposed Bayesian method called posterior correction. Specifically, we show that SVRG is recovered as a special case of posterior correction over the isotropic-Gaussian family, while novel extensions are automatically obtained by using more flexible exponenti...

**Abstract:**  
Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death.

**URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01878v1)

**Abstract:**  
In this work, we propose that reasoning in knowledge graph (KG) networks can be guided by surprise minimization. Entities that are close in graph distance will have lower surprise than those farther apart. This connects the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from neuroscience to KG systems, where the KG serves as the agent's generative model. We formalize surprise using the shortest-path distance in directed graphs and provide a framework for KG-based agents. Graph distance appears in graph neural netw...

**Abstract:**  
Robots in uncertain real-world environments must perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We p...

Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) must navigate safely in cluttered environments while accounting for complex dynamics and environmental uncertainty. Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) offers formal safety guarantees through the computation of forward and backward reachable sets, but its application is hindered by poor scalability in environments with numerous obstacles.

**Abstract:**  
Topologically ordered states are among the most interesting quantum phases of matter that host emergent quasi-particles having fractional charge and obeying fractional quantum statistics. Theoretical study of such states is however challenging owing to their strong-coupling nature that prevents conventional mean-field treatment. Here, we demonstrate that an attention-based deep neural network provides an expressive variational wavefunction that discovers fractional Chern insulator ground states ...

**Abstract:**  
Humans are increasingly forming parasocial relationships with AI systems, and modern AI shows an increasing tendency to display social and relationship-seeking behaviour. However, the psychological consequences of this trend are unknown. Here, we combined longitudinal randomised controlled trials (N=3,532) with a neural steering vector approach to precisely manipulate human exposure to relationship-seeking AI models over time.

**Abstract:**  
Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in data-driven learning and in sampling from complex, unnormalized target distributions. Building on this progress, we reinterpret Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntRL) as a diffusion model-based sampling problem. We tackle this problem by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion policy and the optimal policy distribution using a tractable upper bound. By applying the policy gradient theorem to thi...

Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a lar...

Chaos is a fundamental feature of many complex dynamical systems, including weather systems and fluid turbulence. These systems are inherently difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Many chaotic systems are dissipative and ergodic, motivating data-driven models that aim to learn invariant statistical properties over long time horizons. While recent models have shown empirical success in preserving invariant statistics, they are prone to generating unbounded ...

**Abstract:**  
GUI grounding aims to align natural language instructions with precise regions in complex user interfaces. Advanced multimodal large language models show strong ability in visual GUI grounding but still struggle with small or visually similar targets and ambiguity in real world layouts. These limitations arise from limited grounding capacity and from underuse of existing reasoning potential. We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large ...

**Abstract:**  
Knowledge graphs (KGs) require continual updates as new information emerges, but neural embedding models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. We evaluate Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a regularization-based continual learning method, on KG link prediction using TransE embeddings on FB15k-237.

**URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01881v1)

**Abstract:**  
The training of deep vision models is fundamentally a signal recovery problem amidst high-dimensional stochastic noise. Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversel...

In this work, we propose AirSim360, a simulation platform for omnidirectional data from aerial viewpoints, enabling wide-ranging scene sampling with drones. Specifically, AirSim360 focuses on three key aspects: a render-aligned data and labeling paradigm for pixel-level geometric, semantic, ...

**Abstract:**  
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by their emergent reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which enables thorough exploration and deliberation. Despite these advances, long-CoT LLMs often exhibit suboptimal reasoning behaviors, such as overthinking and excessively protracted reasoning chains, which can impair performance. In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gra...

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation.

**Abstract:**  
Test-time scaling (TTS) -- the dynamic allocation of compute during inference -- is a promising direction for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, a systematic comparison of well-known TTS strategies under identical conditions is missing, and the influence of model type and problem difficulty on performance remains unclear. To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B ...

Besides gaining intuition about how accurate these estimators are, we are interested in the degree to which they can serve as the sole perception mechanism for robotic grasping. To assess this, we perform grasping trials in a physics-based simulator, using image-based pose estimates to guide a parallel gripper and an underactuated robotic hand...

**Abstract:**  
MeanFlow (MF) has recently been established as a framework for one-step generative modeling. However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $...

To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic...

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a "pre...

During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-q...

It shows that seven initially plausible theses about physical reality are jointly inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, while any six are jointly consistent. We must then decide which theses to retain and which to give up. Since different interpretations of quantum mechanics entail different responses to the heptalemma, we get a novel taxonomy of such interpretations. Beyond the application to quantu...

Collective dynamics in proliferating anisotropic particle systems arise from an interplay between growth, division, and mechanical interactions, often mediated by particle shape.
