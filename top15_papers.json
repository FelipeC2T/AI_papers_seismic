      "abstract": "Interpreting seismic horizons is a critical task for characterizing subsurface structures in hydrocarbon exploration. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments.",

      "abstract": "Seismic velocity inversion is a key task in geophysical exploration, enabling the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic wave data. It is critical for high-resolution seismic imaging and interpretation. Traditional physics-driven methods, such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), are computationally demanding, sensitive to initialization, and limited by the bandwidth of seismic data. Recent advances in deep learning have led to data-driven approaches that treat velocity inversion as a dense prediction task. This research benchmarks three advanced encoder-decoder architectures -- U-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+ -- together with SeismoLabV3+, an optimized variant of DeepLabV3+ with a ResNeXt50 32x4d backbone and task-specific modifications -- for seismic velocity inversion using the ThinkOnward 2025 Speed \\& Structure dataset, which consists of five-channel seismic shot gathers paired with high-resolution velocity maps. Experimental results show that SeismoLabV3+ achieves the best performance, with MAPE values of 0.03025 on the internal validation split and 0.031246 on the hidden test set as scored via the official ThinkOnward leaderboard. These findings demonstrate the suitability of deep segmentation networks for seismic velocity inversion and underscore the value of tailored architectural refinements in advancing geophysical AI models.",
